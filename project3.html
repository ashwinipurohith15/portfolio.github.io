								<h2>AWESOME CHOCOLATES DATA ANALYSIS</h2>
								<p>Awesome Chocolate is a new sweet treat company that is trying to build its brand and establish itself internationally. The owner would like some reports created to see how his salespeople are doing, as well as the products & business in general. The owner was able to provide me with transaction data as well as product data. I acted as the company's Data Analyst where I explored the provided data and returned to the owner with reports containing useful insights for the business.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Key Excel Skills Demonstrated</h3>
                                    <p>A confectionery company, specializing in chocolates, wants to maximize its sales and profitability. They need to understand which chocolate products (bars, truffles, gift boxes, dark vs. milk vs. white, specific flavors) are performing best, identify regional preferences, analyze seasonal trends, and potentially optimize their product offerings and marketing efforts.</p>
									<p>Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:</p>

                                  <p>Handling inconsistent product names, correcting typos (e.g., "Dark Choc" vs. "Dark Chocolate").</p>

                                  <p>Managing missing sales figures or date entries.</p>

                                   <p>Standardizing formats (e.g., date formats, currency).</p>

                                   <p>Advanced Formulas & Functions:</p>

                                    <p>COUNTIFS, AVERAGEIFS: To calculate total sales, unit sold, or average price per product, region, or time period.</p>

                                    <p>TEXT functions: To extract month/year from dates for seasonality analysis.</p>

                                     <p>VLOOKUP/XLOOKUP: If you have separate lookup tables for product categories, ingredient costs, or regional population data.</p>

                                     <p>IF/IFS functions: For categorizing products (e.g., "Premium," "Standard") or sales performance (e.g., "High," "Medium," "Low").</p>

                                    <p>CONCATENATE or &: To combine product attributes for unique identifiers.</p>

                                    <p>Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts:</p>

                                    <p>Sales by Product: Analyze total sales and units sold for each chocolate type, flavor, or size. Identify best-sellers and underperformers.</p>

									<p>Regional Performance: Break down sales by city, state, or distribution channel.</p>


									<p>Time Series Analysis: Show sales trends by month, quarter, or year to identify seasonality (e.g., higher sales around holidays like Valentine's Day, Diwali, Christmas).</p>


									<p>Profitability Analysis (if cost data is available): Analyze gross profit margins by product.</p>


									<p>Cross-Tabulation: E.g., Sales of "Dark Chocolate" in "Northern Region" during "Winter."</p>


									<p>Conditional Formatting:</p>


									<p>Highlighting top 10 products, lowest 10 products.</p>


									<p>Visualizing sales targets vs. actuals (e.g., green for meeting target, red for below).</p>


									<p>Highlighting regions with highest/lowest sales growth.</p>


									<p>Data Validation & Dropdowns:</p>


									<p>To create interactive filters on a dashboard (e.g., select a region to view its specific sales data).</p>

                                    <p>Charting & Visualization:</p>


									<p>Bar charts (product comparisons, regional sales).</p>


									<p>Line charts (seasonal trends over time).</p>


									<p>Pie charts (market share of different chocolate types, though use sparingly).</p>


									<p>Combination charts (sales vs. units, or sales vs. profit).</p>


									<p>Basic Dashboard Design:</p>


									<p>Organizing key insights, charts, and interactive elements on a single, easy-to-read sheet.</p>

									<p>"Chocolate Sales Performance Analysis Conducted an in-depth sales performance analysis for a confectionery company using a multi-year dataset of chocolate product sales. Leveraged advanced Excel functionalities, including SUMIFS, VLOOKUP, PivotTables, and dynamic charting, to identify top-performing products, uncover crucial seasonal sales trends, and analyze regional consumption patterns. This project culminated in actionable recommendations for optimizing product portfolio, refining marketing strategies, and improving inventory forecasting, demonstrating strong capabilities in data cleaning, complex formula application, and compelling data visualization to drive business growth."</p>
